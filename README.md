# Hurricane-Analysis

## Overview
This project was for the purpose of analyzing a hurricane data set from certain categorical measures such as mortality count, likely area to have repeated hurricanes and damage severity. The main questions to be answered from this data set were the following:

1. Which area has the most hurricanes?
2. Which particular hurricane had the highest mortality rate?
3. Which hurricane had the highest property damage done?

## Summary Results
1. The most impacted area was Central America.
2. Hurricane Mitch had the highest mortality at 19,325 deaths.
3. Katrina had the highest property damage at 125B.

## Challenges
There were quite a few challenges of this project the biggest being iterating thorugh the dictionaries repeatedly. Another challenge was creating a new function each time to do further analysis. This made the script larger and more inefficient than necessary.

## Use Cases
NGO and governemntal bodies can use this data to prepare for future hurricanes and predict possible scope and damage. This can be further fine tuned if the data set is larger and a machine learning model applied to predict expected size and damage.
